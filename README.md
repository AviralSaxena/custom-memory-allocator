# Custom Memory Allocator

## Overview

This project involved creating a custom implementation of `malloc` and `free` in C, along with additional heap management strategies: Next Fit, Worst Fit, and Best Fit. The goal was to manage memory allocation efficiently and track various statistics related to memory operations.

## Project Details

### Accomplishments
- **Memory Management:**
  - Implemented splitting and coalescing of free blocks.
  - Added Next Fit, Worst Fit, and Best Fit strategies.
- **Functionality:**
  - Developed and ran test programs to debug and validate the implementation.
  - Implemented `realloc` and `calloc`.
- **Performance Analysis:**
  - Benchmarked custom allocators against the standard `malloc`.
  - Analyzed performance, fragmentation, and heap size.
- **Documentation:**
  - Generated a report summarizing the algorithms, test results, and performance comparisons.

## Conclusion

This project significantly enhanced my understanding of the underlying architecture of memory allocators.
